## Technical Highlights

### High-Performance Network Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    IOCP Communication Model              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • I/O Completion Ports: Most efficient async I/O on    │
│    Windows                                               │
│  • Single master supports 10,000+ concurrent connections │
│  • Supports TCP / UDP / KCP transport protocols          │
│  • Auto-chunking for large packets (max 128KB send buf)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Adaptive Quality Control

Intelligent quality adjustment system based on RTT (Round-Trip Time):

| RTT Latency | Quality Level | FPS | Resolution | Compression | Use Case |
|-------------|---------------|-----|------------|-------------|----------|
| < 30ms | Ultra | 25 FPS | Original | DIFF | LAN office |
| 30-80ms | High | 20 FPS | Original | RGB565 | General office |
| 80-150ms | Good | 20 FPS | ≤1080p | H.264 | Cross-network/Video |
| 150-250ms | Medium | 15 FPS | ≤900p | H.264 | Cross-network office |
| 250-400ms | Low | 12 FPS | ≤720p | H.264 | Poor network |
| > 400ms | Minimal | 8 FPS | ≤540p | H.264 | Very poor network |

- **Zero Overhead**: Reuses heartbeat packets to calculate RTT
- **Fast Downgrade**: Triggers after 2 detections, responds to network fluctuations
- **Cautious Upgrade**: Quality improves only after 5 stable readings
- **Cooldown Mechanism**: Prevents frequent switching

### V2 File Transfer Protocol

```cpp
// 77-byte protocol header + filename + data payload
struct FileChunkPacketV2 {
    uint8_t   cmd;            // COMMAND_SEND_FILE_V2 = 85
    uint64_t  transferID;     // Transfer session ID
    uint64_t  srcClientID;    // Source client ID (0=master)
    uint64_t  dstClientID;    // Destination client ID (0=master, C2C)
    uint32_t  fileIndex;      // File index (0-based)
    uint32_t  totalFiles;     // Total file count
    uint64_t  fileSize;       // File size (supports >4GB)
    uint64_t  offset;         // Current chunk offset
    uint64_t  dataLength;     // Current chunk data length
    uint64_t  nameLength;     // Filename length
    uint16_t  flags;          // Flags (FFV2_LAST_CHUNK, etc.)
    uint16_t  checksum;       // CRC16 checksum (optional)
    uint8_t   reserved[8];    // Reserved for extension
    // char filename[nameLength];  // UTF-8 relative path
    // uint8_t data[dataLength];   // File data
};
```

**Features**:
- Large file support (uint64_t breaks 4GB limit)
- Resumable transfer (state persisted to `%TEMP%\FileTransfer\`)
- SHA-256 integrity verification
- C2C direct transfer (client to client)
- V1/V2 protocol compatibility

### Screen Transmission Optimization

- **SSE2 Instructions**: Hardware-accelerated pixel difference calculation
- **Multi-threaded Parallel**: Thread pool for chunked screen data processing
- **Scroll Detection**: Identifies scrolling scenarios, reduces bandwidth by 50-80%
- **H.264 Encoding**: Based on x264, GOP control, video-level compression

### Security Mechanisms

| Layer | Measures |
|-------|----------|
| **Transport Encryption** | AES-256 data encryption with configurable IV |
| **Authentication** | Signature verification + HMAC authentication |
| **Authorization Control** | Serial number binding (IP/domain), multi-level authorization |
| **File Verification** | SHA-256 integrity verification |
| **Session Isolation** | Session 0 independent handling |

### Dependencies

| Library | Version | Purpose |

## Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/yuanyuanxiang/SimpleRemoter/wiki/res/Architecture.jpg)

### Two-Layer Control Architecture (v1.1.1+)

```
Super User
    │
    ├── Master 1 ──> Client Group A (up to 10,000+)
    ├── Master 2 ──> Client Group B
    └── Master 3 ──> Client Group C
```

**Design Advantages**:
- **Hierarchical Control**: Super user can manage any master program
- **Isolation**: Clients managed by different masters are isolated from each other
- **Horizontal Scaling**: 10 Masters × 10,000 clients = 100,000 devices

### Master Program (Server)

The master program **YAMA.exe** provides a graphical management interface:

![Main Interface](./images/Yama.jpg)

- High-performance server based on IOCP
- Client group management
- Real-time status monitoring (RTT, geolocation, active window)
- One-click client generation

### Controlled Program (Client)

![Client Generation](./images/TestRun.jpg)

**Runtime Forms**:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ghost.exe` | Standalone executable, no external dependencies |
| `TestRun.exe` + `ServerDll.dll` | Separate loading, supports in-memory DLL loading |
| Windows Service | Background operation, supports lock screen control |
| Linux Client | Cross-platform support (v1.2.5+) |
